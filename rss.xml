            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Wheelhouse, Downtown Los Angeles</h1><p>Tami and Chase Spenst wanted to build a one-stop shop for the everyday bicycle rider. After finding a space in the heart of Los Angeles' creative community, they designed a warm and approachable indoor/outdoor space (with a service center and coffee bar) and filled it with vintage-inspired bicycles and accessories.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d451662de5f889e0d2ea7540f20fda26793ae992.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google May Have Found a Way to Make the Real-World Web Work</h1><p>Remember beacons? Honestly, there's not much reason you would. Hailed for years by Apple, Google, and beyond as one of the next big things in tech-for marketers, at least-the glorious beacon future has yet to arrive in the present. They may get a little closer, however, now that Google has solved one of their major issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60f00415e118224ecabc9f288eafe337a9d94455.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey. Because his heart was beating irregularly, doctors suspected he had atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, which can increase the risk of stroke. But to decide how to treat him, they needed to know exactly how long his heart had been acting up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e7c2137ca15977fb188a032265cc6aa5dfc153d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Inside, amid the low gray cubicles, clustered desks, and empty swivel chairs, an impossible 8-inch robot drone from an alien planet hovers chest-high in front of a row of potted plants.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c074a0d302be59dce473c720dd3426bf33ec9c32.jpg"></article>]]></description>
