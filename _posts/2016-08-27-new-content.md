  The concept of capitalism undergoing a change. The realisation that our
  current economic model is not sustainable is slowly taking hold (Porter 2011,
  Beinhocker 2014). The reigning modus operandi of firms focussed on maximising
  organisational profit at the expense of customers, is leaving society with
  fundamental problems in virtually any sector, whether it is health care,
  energy, education or the environment. On the backdrop of the radical
  rethinking of capitalism as a system for economic welfare, marketing is in
  need of a similar reboot.

The concept of capitalism undergoing a change. The realisation that our current economic model is not sustainable is slowly taking hold (Porter 2011, Beinhocker 2014). The reigning modus operandi of firms focussed on maximising organisational profit at the expense of customers, is leaving society with fundamental problems in virtually any sector, whether it is health care, energy, education or the environment. On the backdrop of the radical rethinking of capitalism as a system for economic welfare, marketing is in need of a similar reboot.

## MARKETING IS BROKEN

Marketing is broken. Marketing has become synonymous with deceit, coercion and manipulation. Marketing is a discipline where the ability to sell a refrigerator to an eskimo is considered to be a good thing. Marketing needs to re-focus itself and move from a seller of products to solver of societal problems at scale. Going back to the original definition of marketing according to the AMA: Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

## GOOD MARKETING DEFINED

Marketing's main purpose of finding ways to create and deliver customer value at a profit is incomplete. Marketeers need to create shared value (Porter 2011) for customers(1), the organization (2) AND society(3). Marketing aimed to deliver all three aspect of shared value, is defined as GOOD MARKETING.

## GOOD MARKETING IS NOT CSR

GOOD marketing is not corporate responsibility. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) which is beneficial to society in itself, but has one inherently fundamental flaw, CSR does not scale. The problem is that CSR is a cost or a investment with a unclear return at best. More CSR does not equal more profit for the firm, hence investment in CSR will always be marginal and can't be deployed at scale.

## GOOD MARKETING IS GOOD BUSINESS

Marketeers should realize that solving societal problems is not a matter of altruism but rather it is a vehicle of sustainable growth and profit. Understanding and solving the value equation of organizational, customer and societal value means big business. GOOD MARKETING is not a charitable endeavour but more a new business model which provides ample avenues of competitive advantage and thus growth. GOOD MARKETING = Good Business.
